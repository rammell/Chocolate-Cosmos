# Chocolate-Cosmos
Chocolate Cosmos is the innovator in developing clean energy and contemporary weatherbox design. The members of Chocolate Cosmos are engineers Riley, Kenneth, and Sawinna. Chocolate Cosmos, an EE296 team, is part of the Smart-Campus Energy Lab (SCEL), which is a Vertically Integrated Project (VIP).

This is our github repository. All the code here is for our weatherbox. We pull data from sensors, and package them into a packet. Using an Xbee, we send the packet to the database, where it's processed. The data will be used by our Forecasting team to predict weather patterns.
